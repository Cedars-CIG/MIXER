\title{Compute feature-level adaptive weights from ridge coefficients and PIM}
\usage{
compute_feature_weights(ridge_coef_list, pim_df, epsilon = 1e-04)
}
\arguments{
\item{ridge_coef_list}{Named list of data.frames, each with columns \code{SNP} and \code{beta}.}

\item{pim_df}{Data.frame returned by \code{compute_PIM} with columns \code{metric} and \code{PIM}.}

\item{epsilon}{Small constant to avoid zero weights.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\itemize{
\item \code{df_coef}: data.frame containing union of features and per-metric \eqn{|beta|}.
\item \code{df_weight}: data.frame with columns \code{SNP} and \code{weight}.
}
}
\description{
Integrates ridge coefficients across multiple feature sets/metrics and uses the
corresponding PIM weights to construct adaptive feature weights for downstream
adaptive LASSO.
