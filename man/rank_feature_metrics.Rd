\title{Rank features by multiple univariate metrics}
\usage{
rank_feature_metrics(y_train, feature_train, y_val, feature_val)
}
\arguments{
\item{y_train}{Numeric vector (0/1), training outcome.}

\item{feature_train}{Matrix/data.frame of features for training (rows = individuals, cols = features/SNPs).}

\item{y_val}{Numeric vector (0/1), test/validation outcome.}

\item{feature_val}{Matrix/data.frame of features for testing/validation (rows = individuals, cols = features/SNPs).}
}
\value{
A named list of data.frames. Each element corresponds to one metric
and contains columns \code{SNP} and the metric value, sorted from largest to smallest.
}
\description{
Computes per-feature metrics using univariate logistic regression and
returns ranked feature lists (largest to smallest) for each metric.
