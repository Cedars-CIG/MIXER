\title{Example feature matrix for MIXER}
\format{
A data.frame with 5,000 rows and 16,471 columns:
\describe{
\item{IID}{Unique individual identifier.}
\item{feature_1, feature_2, \dots}{Numeric feature columns.}
}
}
\source{
UK Biobank (subsampled and anonymized).
}
\usage{
features_example
}
\description{
\code{features_example} is a high-dimensional example feature matrix included
to demonstrate the end-to-end workflow of the MIXER package. The dataset
contains 5,000 individuals and 16,470 numeric features, along with a unique
identifier column (\code{IID}).
}
\details{
The feature values were derived from a subsample of real-world UK Biobank data
and subsequently anonymized by randomly permuting individuals. This procedure
ensures that no individual-level information is preserved while retaining
realistic marginal distributions, sparsity patterns, and correlation structure
across features. The dataset is provided solely for methodological illustration
and testing purposes.
