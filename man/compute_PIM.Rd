\title{Compute Predictive Importance Metric (PIM) for each feature set}
\usage{
compute_PIM(
  y_train,
  y_val,
  feature_train_list,
  feature_val_list,
  ridge_coef_list,
  n_threshold = 2000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{y_train}{Outcome vector for training set (0/1).}

\item{y_val}{Outcome vector for validation set (0/1).}

\item{feature_train_list}{Named list of training feature matrices (one per feature set / metric).}

\item{feature_val_list}{Named list of validation feature matrices (one per feature set / metric).}

\item{ridge_coef_list}{Named list of ridge regression coefficient data.frames with columns \code{SNP} and \code{beta}.}

\item{n_threshold}{Number of thresholds for scanning in \code{threshold_moving_func}.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with columns \code{metric} (feature-set label) and \code{PIM} (aggregated score).
}
\description{
PIM represents the "predictive importance metric" for each feature set (e.g., each
metric-specific top-ranked subset). It is computed by fitting a PRS model on the
training set, evaluating threshold-dependent performance on the validation set,
and aggregating normalized performance metrics into a single score.
